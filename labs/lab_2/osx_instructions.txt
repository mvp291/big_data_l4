Notes
=====
-- To save some typing, you can add the following aliases to your .bashrc:

alias mysql=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
alias mysqladmin=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin

-- If you change your password to nothing ('newpassword' = ''), then you can omit the -p option

-- If you use Homebrew, then you can ignore all (!) of the preceding instructions and just type: 

  1. brew install mysql
  2. mysql.server start
  3. mysql -u root 
  4. mysql.server stop

   However, we do not officially support Homebrew, so you're on your own if you take this approach!
