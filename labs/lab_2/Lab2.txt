1. Download and Install MySQL from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

MySQL has extensive documentation, with installation instructions for different OSes, e.g., 
  Mac OS X:   
  Windows: http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/windows/

We have summarized the Windows- and Mac-specific instructions in the Lab 2 folder on NYU Classes

2. Start and connect to your MySQL server â€”- see OS-specific instructions referenced in step 1

3. Type the following command:

show databases;

If there is no database named 'test', type:

create database test;

Now type:

use test;
show tables; 



4. You can use SQL to explore the metadata in the database, for example:

select version(), current_date;

select user();

And the results are always tables!



5. You can now start populating your database with tables and the tables with tuples. Try the following commands:

create table branch		
    (name  VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    city CHAR(30),
    assets INT,
    openDate DATE);


insert into branch values ('broadway','new york',20000000,'2000-01-01');
insert into branch values ("fifthave","new york",200000000,"2000-01-01");

select * from branch;

insert into branch values (NULL,"new york",200000000,"1999-01-01");



6. Create a file called branch.txt (make sure the fields are separated by tabs):
soho	new york	5000	1993-02-04	 
midtown	new york	8000	1972-12-24	 
midtown	\N	7000	\N	 
midtown	new york	9000	NULL
midtown	new york	10000	 



7. Load the file you just created by typing:

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/path/branch.txt' INTO TABLE branch;

select * from branch;


8. We can add a column to the table by typing the following:

alter table branch add manager char(30);

describe branch;



9. We can go back and fill in this column for the existing rows. For example, type 

update branch
set manager = "john" where name="broadway";

select * from branch;



10. Now we can delete our table.

delete from branch;

drop table branch;

describe branch;
