## Coursework:
### Programming Assignments (35% - Individual)
* Assignment 1: Querying NYC Taxi data using SQL
* Assignment 2: NYC Taxi data processing using Map/Reduce (Hadoop)

### Project (25% - Group)
Group: Maria Leonor Zamora Maass <mzm239@nyu.edu>, Luisa Eugenia Quispe Ortiz <lqo202@nyu.edu>
The objective of the term project was to analyze a massive dataset using the concepts learned in the course.
We decided to analyze taxi data, in particular we focused on the analysis of short trips (those that could have been made by foot or bike).
